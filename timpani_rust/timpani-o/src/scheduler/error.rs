//! Structured error types for the Timpani-O global scheduler.
//!
//! Two error enums model the two failure layers:
//!
//! * [`AdmissionReason`] — why a single task was rejected by a specific node
//!   (low-level, carries exact resource values).
//! * [`SchedulerError`] — top-level failure returned from
//!   [`GlobalScheduler::schedule()`](super::GlobalScheduler::schedule).
//!
//! # Automotive note
//! Every variant carries enough structured data to:
//! 1. Emit a fully-qualified `tracing` event (task name, node, values).
//! 2. Generate a DTC / DEM event when the fault reporting proto is extended.
//! 3. Be matched by the gRPC handler to map to an appropriate `tonic::Status`
//!    code.
//!
//! **Do not** replace these with `anyhow::Error` in production paths — the
//! structured variants are intentional.
